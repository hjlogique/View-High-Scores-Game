The “View High Scores Game” is a timed online quiz application. 
Players select the "Start" button to start the game. Next they
answer questions with given four answers. One of the answers is
the correct answer. For any incorrect answer, players lose
10 seconds of the time available to them. The time is displayed 
during the game. For the purpose of this project only 5 very 
simple questions were included, each of which is worth 20 points. 
The game is only 70 seconds long. Once players answer all 
questions or the time reaches the end, the game stops and the 
score of the player is displayed. Players are asked to enter
their name and save their scores. By selecting the Save Score 
button, players' scores are saved. Then the Players Score page 
with a list of all players and their scores is displayed. Here
Players can clear the list and also replay the game.

I accomplished the followings:

- Created an application that generates questions, answers, and other 
  HTML elements, and stylized them dynamically through JavaScript.  
- Created Bootstrap components through JavaScript dynamically to make 
  the application responsive. 
- Coded JavaScript to time players, and evaluate their selected answers
  to generate their scores.
- Used JSON to store list of players and their scores locally and display
  them.
- Coded JavaScript to clear the stored scores, and allow players to replay 
  the game.
- Tested the overall functionality of the app for all possible answers.
- Uploaded the updated files to my personal GitHub repository, and made the 
  URLs to my deployed application, and my GitHub repository available.
